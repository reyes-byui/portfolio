              <h2>Hi. Are you happy today and ready to go? First, let's hear some music. <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/media/music/songs/ill-go-where-you-want-me-to-go?crumbs=hymns&lang=eng" target="_blank" class="music"><br><br>Hymn 270: I'll Go Where You Want Me To Go</a></h2>
              <p class="post-intro">
                  Starting my morning with wholesome music has become part of my daily life. When I was younger, new to the real world, I was one of those teens giggling over popular music artists. I won't name them before you guess when I was born and how old I am now.<br><br>When challenges of adulthood started striking me, the messages from those music only made me emotionally and mentally chaotic. My cousin said listening to party beats would made me feel better. That was over a decade and a half. 
              </p>
              <h3 class="quote">
              The only music that created a deeper and long-lasting impact in my life are the church hymns and Ghibli's piano music.
              </h3>
              <p class="post-intro">
                Before we go further, I want to share my testimony that the church hymns are divine messages accompanied with the harmony and love of our Heavenly Father. They are spiritually uplifting prayers that help us feel the Holy Ghost that we need every second in this life. There is no music that is more powerful, strengthening and clarifying than these sacred hymns.

            <h4>Hymns of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</h4>
            <p class="post-intro">My childhood was filled with primary songs, musical plays, roadshows and Sunday classes with my childhood friends. For those who grew up in the church, we have the kindest memories of how the church hymns shaped our understanding of the gospel. As I get older, I gain a deeper understanding of what the church hymns are really for.<br><br>Currently, there are 341 hymns in Hymns of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The songs in this hymnbook are often played during sacrament meetings and Sunday schools. In most gatherings, church members start with a hymn followed by an opening prayer that everyone may be reminded to practice reverence and a mind of humility and kindness.

          <h4>The Everlasting Impact of The Church Hymns</h4>
          <p class="post-intro">
          Children's Songs have an everlasting impact in my memories. While I do remember the rise of Western music in the 90's and witnessed the rise of K-Pop in 2000's, nothing beats my memories of primary kids' Christmas carols in a sacrament meeting and family home evenings.<br><br>In my 30's, I still sing primary songs and it makes my day brighter. There's just this kind, positive feeling that helps me perceive daily challenges with hope.</p>
          <h4>Refraining From Wordly Music</h4>
          <p class="post-intro">
          In my understanding, there are two kinds of music: the bad one and the good one. Bad music are those that inhibit negative thoughts and feelings. Good music are those that remind us to be faithful, hopeful, positive and forgiving.<br><br><span class="highlight">Music is powerful. It has the power to encourage emotions.</span> From our emotions, to our thoughts, to our actions, it has an influential impact within us. Isn’t it true? It’s like it has a remote control to every kind of emotion we have.
          <br><br>
          For the worst instance I could think of, researchers suggest that there is a link between music and suicidal feelings and thoughts. While the topic is complex, music with dark and depressive themes may correlate with suicidal ideation in many individuals. Though results are not established, findings from different studies show an angle of this possibility.
          <br><br>
          Reading from Music and Suicidality: A Quantitative Review and Extension, the study provided a quantitative review of 90 findings across 21 studies, analyzing the relationship between music and suicidality. It was found that ecological data on suicide completions were 19.2 times more likely to report a link between music and suicide. However, experimental research failed to establish causation, suggesting that music's impact is more likely to be reflective to preexisting vulnerabilities rather than a direct cause. (Stack, Lester, & Rosenberg, 2012)
          <br><br>
          From The Effect of Country Music on Suicide, there was an examination on the link between country music airtime and suicide rates in urban white populations. It found that greater exposure to country music correlated with higher suicide rates, although cultural and socioeconomic factors were also significant contributors. (Stack & Gundlach, 1992)
          <br><br>
          Music has psychosocial benefits from the engaging beats and lyrics related to common issues that most of us could relate to or situations we have experienced like heartbreak, peer pressure, family problems, vices and many other current social issues.  
          <br><br>
          Another example is an analysis of heavy metal music found that while its intense themes are often linked to depression, many fans use it as a form of emotional catharsis rather than as a trigger for negative behaviors. The findings emphasized that individual differences play a significant role in how music influences mental health​. (Stack & Gundlach, 1995)
          <br><br>
          While these studies suggest that the relationship between music and suicide is complex, with no direct causation established, music might amplify emotional states or reflect preexisting vulnerabilities, but it also has the potential for therapeutic benefits depending on the individual and context. I think the worst influence of music on our well-being is either it cause us to end our lives or we end someone’s life, which is Satan’s purpose, that we may not receive eternal life.
          <br><br>
          <span class="highlight">Music is powerful. It has the power to help us remember our duties or the opposite. It can make us remember humility, kindness and forgiveness or the opposite. The goal of worldly music is to please the world. The goal of hymns is to help us be not of this world.</span>
          <br><br>
          <h4>Choosing Your Daily Music</h4>
          <p class="post-intro">
          Music is powerful. For our own well-being, it is wise to choose our kind of music.
          <br><br>
          We may set boundaries of how worldly music may influence us, but I dare not to challenge any force. I perceive worldly music as dual nature. It is both an artistic expression and a potential influencer of human thoughts and emotions. "Worldly music" as being tied to this world, acknowledges music as an earthly construct deeply interwoven with human culture, emotions, and experiences. Worldly music, in this context, encapsulates the melodies, rhythms, and lyrics that reflect and amplify the human condition — joy, sorrow, love, despair, and everything in between. It serves as a mirror to our shared reality, a creative outlet shaped by society’s triumphs, struggles, and individuality.
          <br><br>
          Setting boundaries underscores an awareness of music’s ability to influence us differently, recognizing that what inspires us might dishearten another. Boundaries can mean being mindful of the type of music one chooses to listen to, its content, and its emotional resonance. For example, some may find solace in music that mirrors their emotions, while others might actively avoid certain genres or themes that they perceive as negatively impacting their mental or emotional states.
          <br><br>
          Understanding that music, as a force, operates on multiple levels—psychological, cultural, and possibly spiritual. This humility might stem from recognizing that the power of music extends beyond conscious control. Its ability to evoke deep emotions, forge connections, and even inspire societal movements makes it a force that can shape individuals and communities in profound ways.
          <br><br>
          I am not hear to have you dislike popular music artists but to share how refraining from worldly music and indulging in righteous music, especially during times of trials, have blessed me with the right mind and heart during the times I am clouded with doubts, anger, frustration, loneliness, sorrow, disappointment and pain.

          God's love for all of us have started before we were born on Earth. He manifests it through the prophets, revelators, teachers, to our Savior. It did not stop after the atonement of Christ. It continues through the scriptures, to the living prophet, to the Church Hymns to our kindest remembrance of our divine purpose.
