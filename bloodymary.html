            <h3 class="title-animation">The Beginning</h3>
            <p >I was born the youngest, the smartest, the dumbest, the simplest, yet the most unwanted member in my family.
            <br><br>
            I was an abused child....
            <br><br>
            When I was in grade school, my father was a womanizer and spent all my mother’s money on his mistresses and on drugs. We suffered financial hardships, which made my mother different from how I knew her as a little child. Whenever she’s angry, she vented her anger on me, of all her children, because whenever she apologized, I also apologized for being, I don’t know, a bad child? Then I tried harder to please her. I thought I did something wrong. She developed that habit until I graduated in high school. I didn’t even see that I’ve been being abused trying to understand why I was being hurt.</p>
            <h3 class="title-animation">Mission Over Profession</h3>
            <p>I got a full-scholarship to college. I went to pre-med school. It was my mom’s dream to become a doctor and I wanted to make her happy. During those years, I was free to be me. But after graduating from pre-med, I was inspired to serve on a mission and followed what the Spirit prompted. I gave up on my scholarship. That was the last time I made the right choice and my mission was the most fruitful part of my life so far. My mother didn’t let me have peace though. She always asked me to go home to help them with their financial situation. I thought they were at worst but when I went home two months before I finished my 18-months, they were actually fine. She just couldn’t lower her lifestyle. Do I regret serving on a mission? Never. What I regret is I did not realize earlier that I wanted to become a full-time missionary. If I did, I would not have gotten myself a butterfly tattoo.</p>
            <h3 class="title-animation">Bullying is Real But Bullying Among Adults is Worse</h3>
            <p>I did hate myself for being so stupid and faithless. I tried hard for a couple of years to rely on my faith battling with self-hate. In my first job, my boss attempted to assault me in his car but I was quick to escape. I was helpless as he was a wealthy man. But the following week, he was caught by the police for another cause: he was caught with drugs in his compartment. In my second job, I was bullied by a dozen of envious women because I was in line for pitboss before the pioneer employees. They even called their gangster friends to gang up on me outside the company but I called the security on them. Later on I quit being unhappy there. They were like vultures waiting for me to fall.</p>
            <h3 class="title-animation">"Your Best Fried Is Your Enemy"</h3>    
            <p>At my third job, I was hired gaming assistant at a casino. My closest friend at church failed the interview. After my probation, I did what I can to get her into the admin position without going through the hiring process. Not two months yet she set me up. She said she was being bullied by her co-admin and she showed everyone my texts where I was angry, swearing at those other employees. I was truly mad why they were bullying my friend. I confronted the entire department, until our HR got involved and proved that my friend was lying to me. She got fired. I was so embarrassed and ashamed although our HR understood me well what drove me to be like that. I voluntarily resigned  and apologized to everybody. We were all working well together. We were all sharing a 4-bedroom condo unit, having house parties, shared dinner every night, celebrated birthdays and even took a bath all together to avoid getting late at work then I suddenly spoke harsh to everyone just because of one lying childhood friend.</p>
            <h3 class="title-animation">The Worst Bullying</h3>
            <p>I made good friends in my next work place. I quit when church members started talking about me because I was working in the casino. After that I went to Japan with a group of dancers and entertainers. That’s when I rebelled. I started drinking, tried some drugs but never to addiction and sex. I tried to get help from the church in Japan but my Japanese boss did not like the idea of me connecting to other organizations afraid that I’d find a new employer. But there  I was bullied again by Filipino women because I received tips after our show. Every night, I received an average $200. The basic pay was small because my manager cut about 60% and we all get just 40% so I saved up from tips that was why they were jealous. I did split it with my main team but they still hated me. Then there was this other dancer from Manila. Our boss did not plan to hire her since he cannot pay for more people and she needed more training. Later on his business got better in two months, my boss took her in. She’d always phone me that she needed that job. When she arrived in Japan, she joined my bullies. There was no day of my life that I was not brokenhearted but my hatred and the understanding that nobody truly loved me blinded me. I didn’t see anything but black. One time, a dozen of older women surrounded me at the dressing room to fry me. I stood on my knees trying to be strong. I left without finishing my contract when I figured out I was being targeted by one Filipina woman’s boyfriend, who was a yakuza member. I talked to my boss that I didn’t need another hell. Before I left they were all apologizing and crying but I couldn’t believe any of them after putting my life at risk.</p>
            <h3 class="title-animation">Sihanoukville</h3>
            <p>Then, I went to Cambodia. We were in Sihanoukville on a tour. There I met a previous casino manager I know and the same friend who set me up at my second work place was with her, too. She told me she went there to work as a dealer. She said we could do it together. I thought we could be okay. I give chances. The first day at work, she was wearing a pitboss uniform and told me that the night before, she didn’t stop asking our manager to give her a chance to be in that position. Every day, she would stand in front of me to display her uniform, to show that her position is higher than mine and would tease me in the table so I’d make mistakes. After five months, I quit my job when my Korean and Ukranian friends went home. For a period of time I was inactive at church doing dumb things. I felt like if I didn’t do those things, I would do worse to myself. I accepted I was going to hell since not even my family loved me.
            </p>
            <h3 class="title-animation">The Lifeguard</h3>
            <p>I gave up on myself. I was exhausted. I went on a holiday in the Philippines to fix my work papers. While waiting for my documents to be released, I went to a beach in the northern island to think. That beach has magnetic field, part of the Manila Trench. It is where the island’s hydropower is coming from. Once one gets in the field, it would be difficult to get out. They said a few have died there. It didn’t do me good going there. I just felt more alone and worthless, that breathing was pointless. I waited for the lifeguard to leave his post at noon break. I decided to drown myself to death. But, he was there, I didn’t know where he was at but he saved me. He brought me back to the benches. He said “God loves you” and I said “I know that but I hate myself. I wish I was not me. I don’t love myself”. He said try harder, there is always hope then he left me. I was asking myself, hope for what? I didn’t even want anything. I was just crying there for hours. In the afternoon I was looking for him but the resort manager pointed at a different person. That was definitely not him. I described the man. He was huge, muscular, dark, pointy chin and without hair. He looked like a muscular and bald version of Aladdin. He was laughing because there was only one lifeguard. Until today, I can recognize him if I see him again.</p>
            <h3 class="title-animation">Another Abuse</h3>
            <p>So, when I went back to Cambodia, I started attending church and President Collin was there. I finally had my temple recommend renewed after some period of time. Then my husband came to my life. He has been a good friend since after my mission. My friend’s husband introduced him to me then he went to Cambodia for a holiday. We started a relationship during covid and made plans. Then after he finished college, we got married and not four days yet, he changed until I figured out he’s been cheating on me while he was in college. I forgave him but every day he treated me like crap. Every day he was making reasons for us to fight. He kept doing what I hate like him leaving before I get home from work and he would mess the house every day before going out. I wanted to have dinner together, go to Phnom Penh every Saturday night so we could attend church, split the household choirs because I am also studying at night.
            <br>
            He just wanted to travel right away but I had work to finish and preparations to do so we could transfer to Japan. I was exhausted every day, working all day, studying at night and doing all the work at home. We only met during bed time. He would only get up in the morning if I make breakfast. I found out more about his lies later on when he left his iPad at home. I read a chatbox in his instagram. He told his female friend that he was just traveling Asia and never told his colleagues that he already has a wife. That was why he was rushing to travel, to make his lies come true to other people. He was so mad at me and physically hurt me. He told me to leave the church then I said I will choose to suffer or to lose anything for our marriage but not that. A week after that he abandoned me. He wasn’t God’s plan for me. Maybe I was just so happy that someone I love chose me. These past years, I thank God for removing him from my life. I wasted so much on our annulment. Our government did not deem marriage abandonment as a valid ground. I fasted a lot for it until he volunteered to file the divorce in the US. Now I am at peace because I don’t have to do anything anymore with that.</p>
            <h3 class="title-animation">I never wanted anything in my life but to be loved by my loved ones and that was my sin.</h3>
            <p>Because of the experiences I went through in my life, I didn’t see how much God actually has been loving me even in those situations. The comfort He was providing, I didn’t feel those. Do I ask God why do I experience so much betrayals? I did, a lot. And until today I still don’t understand but I want to focus on my purpose since I don’t really feel anything positive about looking for answers. However, I have difficulty overcoming my fear of making friends with women. I would be kind but I don’t want to have a best friend again. I would be someone’s sister but I don’t know what it feels like to have a sister because my sister was the first sister who betrayed me. We recently reconciled and I am so grateful and joyful but we are now on a different stage of life. I don't feel comfortable being at home. I don't know what it feels like to be at home. I don’t know how it feels to be loved back by my loved ones. Those facts made me miserable but after drowning, none of those mattered any more. What does it matter, God’s love is more than enough. I know what it feels like to be loved by God. I know how God loves me. I know the joy of being in His presence. I know my Savior and I know the joy of following His examples.
            <br><br>
            I don’t share my story to everyone I know or to anyone who asks out of curiosity because firstly, don’t want anyone to hate or judge my beloved ones. Secondly, I don’t want anyone to feel sad for me or pity me. But maybe by sharing it to someone,  I could testify that there is great strength in  remembering God’s love. Remembering my covenant is as important as remembering God's love. Maybe I could show better how God makes miracles to save us. Maybe I can describe more what hoping means. Maybe by this I could be an example of learning how to be kind. You cannot really learn what it truly means to be kind if you do not experience unkind things just like you cannot learn repentance if you don't sin. Doing right things to others despite whatever others did to me is one thing I can be honestly happy about.
            <br><br>
            I am happy for those who do not have to go through that kind of road. It was painful, bitter, dark, scary, and difficult. I thought I couldn’t get out but nothing is more important than enduring and serving faithfully, hopefully, prayerfully, obediently and gratefully in any situation. Maybe this life cannot erase our bad memories, if you have one. However, while we still have time, through God’s mercy, we can do better things for others that we all might have better days. I learned to stop expecting anything from anyone around me when I started accepting that nothing can ever satisfy my need for love and protection but Heavenly Father. God has a plan and I hold on to that. Everyone and everything may be go away but God will never leave us. I learned to love myself and value the life that was given to me. I learned to be grateful for everything I have. I learned to be kind to everyone, even to those who hurt me. I learned to forgive. I want to be a better daughter of God and be worthy of His plans for me.
            <br><br>
            Bloody Mary was the last liquor I had. I wanted to be numb even just for a while. I did not feel pain but I also did not feel joy. If I did not sin, who would tell you how horrible it was? I am who I am today because of the road I went through and God did not leave me.
