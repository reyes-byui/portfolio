            <h3 class="title-animation">The Beginning</h3>
            <p>I was born the youngest, the smartest, the dumbest, the simplest, yet the most unwanted member of my family.
            <br><br>
            I was an abused child—a secret known only to my family. I won’t go into details, but I was bullied both at home and at school.
            <br><br>
            During grade school, my father was a womanizer who squandered my mother’s money on mistresses and drugs. This led to financial hardships that changed my mother from the loving figure I once knew. Whenever she was angry, she vented her frustration on me, of all her children. Even when she apologized, I found myself apologizing too, unsure of what I had done wrong. I tried harder to please her, believing I was at fault. This pattern continued until I graduated high school. How did I cope? I focused on excelling at school, attending seminary classes, and learning new things.</p>
            <h3 class="title-animation">Mission Over Profession</h3>
            <p>I earned a full scholarship to college and pursued pre-med, fulfilling my mother’s dream of becoming a doctor. I wanted to make her happy. During those years, I felt free to be myself. However, after graduating, I felt a spiritual prompting to serve a mission. I gave up my scholarship, and I believe it was the last truly right decision I made. My mission became the most fruitful chapter of my life. Sharing the gospel was easier with a name tag. Yet, my mother didn’t allow me peace. She constantly urged me to return home, claiming financial struggles. When I finally went home two months before completing my 18-month commitment, I discovered they were fine—she simply couldn’t adjust her lifestyle. Do I regret serving a mission and giving up my scholarship? Not at all. What I regret is not realizing sooner that I wanted to be a full-time missionary. If I had, I wouldn’t have gotten a butterfly tattoo. I also regret not entrusting my family to God’s care earlier. I wish I had been more faithful for their sake.</p>
            <h3 class="title-animation">Bullying is Real, But Bullying Among Adults is Worse</h3>
            <p>I hated myself for being so naive and faithless. For years, I struggled to rely on the good left in me while battling self-hate. In my first job, my boss attempted to assault me in his car, but I managed to escape. I felt helpless because he was a wealthy man. A week later, he was arrested for drug possession. In my second job, I was bullied by a dozen envious women because I was in line for a pit boss position ahead of the pioneer employees. They even called their gangster friends to intimidate me outside the company, but I reported them to security. Eventually, I quit because I was unhappy there. They were like vultures waiting for me to fall.</p>
            <h3 class="title-animation">My Dearest Friend</h3>    
            <p>At my third job, I was hired as a gaming assistant at a casino. My closest friend from church failed the interview. After my probation, I did everything I could to get her into an admin position without going through the hiring process. But within two months, she betrayed me. She claimed she was being bullied by her co-admins and showed everyone my angry text messages where I defended her. Furious, I confronted the entire department until HR got involved and revealed that my friend had lied to me. She was fired for multiple offenses I hadn’t known about. I was embarrassed and ashamed, even though HR understood my intentions. I voluntarily resigned and apologized to everyone. We had been working well together, sharing a 4-bedroom condo, hosting house parties, and celebrating birthdays. Yet, I had spoken harshly to everyone because of one lying childhood friend.</p>
            <h3 class="title-animation">The Worst Bullying</h3>
            <p>I made good friends at my next workplace but quit when church members began gossiping about me for working in a casino. Afterward, I went to Japan with a group of dancers and entertainers. That’s when I rebelled. I started drinking, tried drugs (though never to addiction and sex). I sought help from the church in Japan, but my boss disapproved, fearing I’d find a new employer. Once again, I was bullied—this time by Filipino women who resented the tips I received after our shows. I earned an average of $200 in tips nightly, while our manager took 60% of our basic pay. Despite splitting my tips with my main team, they still hated me. 
            <br><br>
            Then, a dancer from the Philippines joined us. Initially, our boss didn’t plan to hire her due to budget constraints and her lack of training. However, his business improved, and he brought her in. She had begged me for help getting the job, but once in Japan, she joined my bullies. Every day felt like heartbreak. The pain from knowing that no one truly loved me blinded me. One day, a dozen older women surrounded me in the dressing room to humiliate me. I stood my ground but eventually left without finishing my contract after learning I was being targeted by a yakuza member connected to one of the women. Before I left, they apologized and cried, but I couldn’t trust them after they had put my life at risk.</p>
            <h3 class="title-animation">Sihanoukville</h3>
            <p>Later, I went to Cambodia with some foreign friends from Manila. In Sihanoukville, I met a former casino manager I knew—and the same friend who had betrayed me at my second workplace. She claimed she was working as a dealer and suggested we work together. I thought we could reconcile. On my first day, she wore a pit boss uniform and bragged about convincing the manager to promote her. Every day, she flaunted her position and teased me at the table, hoping I’d make mistakes. After five months, I quit. For a time, I was inactive in church and made poor choices. I felt that if I didn’t break church standards, I might do something worse to end my pain. I accepted that I was going to hell since not even my family loved me.</p>
            <h3 class="title-animation">The Lifeguard</h3>
            <p>Exhausted and hopeless, I went on holiday in the Philippines to fix my work papers. While waiting for my documents, I visited a beach in the northern islands to reflect. The beach, part of the Manila Trench, had a magnetic field that made it difficult to leave. Some said people had died there. It only deepened my loneliness and despair. I decided to drown myself during the lifeguard’s noon break. But he was there. I don’t know where he came from, but he saved me. He brought me back to the benches and said, “God loves you.” I replied, “I know, but I wish I wasn’t me. Maybe if I weren’t me, I wouldn’t go through these things.” He told me to try harder and that there was always hope, then left. I cried for hours, wondering, hope for what? Later, I searched for him, but the resort manager pointed to someone else—a man who looked nothing like the lifeguard who saved me. I described him: tall, muscular, dark-skinned, bald, with a pointy chin. The manager laughed, saying there was only one lifeguard. I want to believe he was sent by God to save me...</p>
            <h3 class="title-animation">Another Abuse</h3>
            <p>When I returned to Cambodia, I resumed attending church, and our branch president was there to support me. After some time, I was able to renew my temple recommend. It was during this period that my ex-husband entered my life. He had been a good friend for years, introduced to me by my friend's husband. He came to Cambodia for a holiday, and we began a relationship during the COVID pandemic, making plans for the future. After he completed college, we got married. However, shortly after our wedding, his behavior changed drastically. I discovered things he had done during his college years, but I chose to forgive him. Despite this, he treated me poorly every day, constantly making reasons to argue.
            <br><br>
            He continued to engage in behaviors I disagreed with, such as leaving the house before I returned from work, leaving me to have dinner alone every evening. The house was always in disarray when I came home, adding to my exhaustion after a long day. I longed for simple things like having dinner together, traveling to Phnom Penh on Saturday nights to attend church, and sharing household responsibilities, especially since I was also studying at night. These seemed like reasonable expectations in a marriage, but he showed no interest in building a life together. Our relationship became a constant struggle, and it was clear he was not committed to our marriage.</p>
            <br><br><p>
            He was eager to travel immediately, but I had responsibilities to complete and preparations to make for our move to Japan. Every day was exhausting—I worked tirelessly, studied at night, and managed all the household tasks. We barely spent time together, only crossing paths at bedtime. In the mornings, he would only get up if I made breakfast. One day, he left his iPad at home, and I discovered messages on his Instagram. He had told a female friend that he was just traveling through Asia and never mentioned being married. It became clear why he was in such a rush to travel—he wanted to maintain his lies while keeping me a secret. 
            <br><br>
            When I confronted him, he became furious and physically hurt me. He demanded that I leave the church, but I stood firm, telling him I was willing to endure any suffering or loss for our marriage, but I would never abandon my faith. A week later, he abandoned me. Looking back, I realize he wasn’t part of God’s plan for me. Perhaps I was just overjoyed that someone I loved had chosen me. 
            <br><br>
            In the years since, I’ve thanked God for removing him from my life. The annulment process was draining, and our government didn’t recognize marriage abandonment as valid grounds. I fasted and prayed for resolution until he eventually filed for divorce in the U.S. on his own. Now, I feel at peace, knowing I no longer have to carry that burden.
            </p>
            <h3 class="title-animation">I never wanted anything in my life but to be loved by my loved ones and that was my sin.</h3>
            <p>I spent some time opening the scriptures and when I opened it, the first that showed up was:</p>
            <div class="REL390">
                <p style="color: white;"><a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/1?lang=eng&id=p18#p18" target="_blank">Isaiah 1:18
            <br>
            “Come now, and let us reason together, saith the Lord: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.”</a></p>
            </div>
            <br>
            <p>The challenges I faced in life often blinded me to the depth of God’s love, which was present even in my darkest moments. I struggled to feel the comfort He was offering and often questioned why I endured so much betrayal. Though I still don’t fully understand, I’ve chosen to focus on my purpose rather than dwell on unanswered questions. Despite this, I find it difficult to overcome my fear of forming close friendships with women. I can be kind and friendly, but I no longer seek or expect deep bonds like best friendships. My first experience of betrayal came from my own sister. While we’ve recently reconciled—a blessing for which I am deeply grateful—we are now in different stages of life, and I still struggle to feel at home or truly loved by my family. I don't know how it feels to be loved back by my loved ones.
            <br><br>
            These feelings once consumed me with misery, but after being saved from death, I realized they no longer hold the same weight. What truly matters is God’s love, which is more than enough. I know what it feels like to be cherished by Him, to experience the joy of His presence, and to follow the example of my Savior. His love has taught me that even when the world feels cold, His warmth is constant and unwavering.</p>
            <br><br><p>
            I rarely share my story—not out of shame or a desire to conceal it, but to avoid judgment or resentment toward my family. Each of us is shaped by our experiences and the choices we make. I also don’t seek pity or sorrow from others. Instead, by sharing my journey, I hope to bear witness to the incredible strength that comes from embracing God’s love. Holding fast to my covenant is as essential as holding fast to His love. Through my experiences, I wish to illustrate how God performs miracles to save us, the true meaning of hope, and the transformative power of kindness. Loving your enemies is one of life’s greatest challenges, but it’s through experiencing unkindness that we truly understand what it means to be kind. Likewise, repentance becomes meaningful only when we recognize our sins. Without repentance, we cannot fully grasp the depth of the Savior’s love. I am thankful my heart did not turn into stone and I was able to learn repentance. Bloody Marry was the last cup I had before I realized that I was not meant to be a sinner. I was meant to be a daughter of God. If I did not sin, I wouldn't truly know how horrible it was. I am grateful for the love that has transformed my perception about myself.
            <br><br>
            Choosing to do good to others, regardless of how I’ve been treated is something that makes me honestly happy. I am grateful for those who haven’t had to walk the same painful, bitter, and dark path I did. It was a journey filled with fear and difficulty, one I thought I’d never escape. Yet, God blessed me with wisdom and softened my heart, guiding me through it all. Nothing is more important than enduring and serving faithfully, prayerfully, obediently, and gratefully in every situation. While this life may not erase our painful memories, through God’s mercy, we can create better days by doing good for others. 
            <br><br>
            I’ve come to understand that placing my trust in Heavenly Father is the only way to find true love and protection. His plan is flawless, and I choose to embrace it with faith and gratitude. While people and circumstances may shift, God’s love remains steadfast and unchanging. This realization has taught me to appreciate my own worth, cherish the life I’ve been given, and recognize the countless blessings around me. It has also inspired me to forgive and extend kindness, even to those who have caused me pain. My deepest aspiration is to grow as a faithful daughter of God and live a life that aligns with His divine purpose.
            <br><br>
            At present, I am taking some time alone to reflect and find solace. While memories of the past occasionally bring me to tears but there are moments I laught about it. Perhaps I resemble one of those quirky, nerd characters bullied on movies...
            <br><br>
            Through all the trials and tribulations I have faced, I have come to know that God's love is unwavering and eternal. Even in my darkest moments, when I felt unworthy and broken, He was there, guiding me, lifting me, and reminding me of my worth. I have learned that no matter how far we stray, His arms are always open to welcome us back. My heart is filled with gratitude for His mercy and grace, for the strength He has given me to endure, and for the hope that He has planted in my soul. I testify that through faith, repentance, and obedience, we can find peace and joy, even amidst life's storms. God’s love is real, and it is the greatest gift we can ever receive. I am who I am today because of His love as I went through that road.
            <br><br>
            The future is uncertain. I don’t know if I will marry again, have a family of my own, or pursue a path something entirely different. Whatever God asks of me to do... One thing I am certain of—whatever lies ahead, God’s plan is sufficient to keep us moving forward.
