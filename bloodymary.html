            <h3 class="title-animation">The Beginning</h3>
            <p >I was born the youngest, the smartest, the dumbest, the simplest, yet the most unwanted member in my family.
            <br><br>
            I was an abused child. That's a secret nobody ever knew other than my family. I won't go on details but I was bullied by my family. I was bullied at school.
            <br><br>
            When I was in grade school, my father was a womanizer and spent all my mother’s money on his mistresses and on drugs. We suffered financial hardships, which made my mother different from how I knew her as a little child. Whenever she’s angry, she vented her anger on me, of all her children, because whenever she apologized, I also apologized for being, I don’t know, a bad child? I tried harder to please her. I thought I did something wrong. She developed that habit until I graduated in high school. How I took it? I did what I had to do as a teenager. I continued doing good at school, at seminary classes and studied other things.</p>
            <h3 class="title-animation">Mission Over Profession</h3>
            <p>I got a full-scholarship to college. I went to pre-med school. It was my mom’s dream to become a doctor and I wanted to make her happy. During those years, I was free to be me. But after graduating from pre-med, I was inspired to serve on a mission and followed what the Spirit prompted. I gave up on my scholarship and I think that was the last time I made the right choice. My mission was the most fruitful part of my life so far. It was a lot easier to share the gospel when you have a name tag. My mother didn’t let me have peace though. She always asked me to go home to help them with their financial situation. I thought they were at worst but when I went home two months before I finished my 18-months commitment, they were actually fine. She just couldn’t lower her lifestyle. Do I regret serving on a mission and giving up my scholarship? Never. What I regret is I did not realize earlier that I wanted to become a full-time missionary. If I did, I would not have gotten myself a butterfly tattoo. What I regret is I did not leave my family to God's hands. I wish I was more faithful for my family.</p>
            <h3 class="title-animation">Bullying is Real But Bullying Among Adults is Worse</h3>
            <p>I did hate myself for being so stupid and faithless. I tried hard for a couple of years to rely on the good left in me while battling with self-hate. In my first job, my boss attempted to assault me in his car but I was quick to escape. I was helpless as he was a wealthy man. But the following week, he was caught by the police for another cause: he was caught with drugs in his compartment. In my second job, I was bullied by a dozen of envious women because I was in line for pitboss before the pioneer employees. They even called their gangster friends to gang up on me outside the company but I called the security on them. Later on I quit being unhappy there. They were like vultures waiting for me to fall.</p>
            <h3 class="title-animation">My Dearest Friend</h3>    
            <p>At my third job, I was hired gaming assistant at a casino. My closest friend at church failed the interview. After my probation, I did what I can to get her into the admin position without going through the hiring process. Not two months yet she set me up. She said she was being bullied by her co-admin and she showed everyone my text messages to her where I was angry, swearing at those other employees. I was very mad why they were bullying my friend. I confronted the entire department, until our HR got involved and proved that my friend was lying to me. She got fired. I did not know she have done several offenses. I was so embarrassed and ashamed although our HR understood me well what drove me to be like that. I voluntarily resigned  and apologized to everybody. We were all working well together. We were all sharing a 4-bedroom condo unit, having house parties, shared dinner every night, celebrated birthdays and even took a bath all together to avoid getting late at work and I surprisingly spoke harsh to everyone just because of one lying childhood friend.</p>
            <h3 class="title-animation">The Worst Bullying</h3>
            <p>I made good friends in my next work place. I quit when church members started talking about me because I was working in the casino. After that I went to Japan with a group of dancers and entertainers. That’s when I rebelled. I started drinking, tried some drugs but never to addiction and sex. I tried to get help from the church in Japan but my boss did not like the idea of me connecting to other organizations afraid that I’d find a new employer. But there  I was bullied again by Filipino women because I received tips after our show. Every night, I received an average $200. The basic pay was small since ouor manager cut about 60% of our contract. I was saving more than they did. I did split my tips with my main team but they still hated me. Then there was this other dancer in the Philippines. Our boss did not plan to hire her since he cannot pay for more people and she needed more training. Later on his business got better in two months, my boss took her in. She’d always phone me that she needed that job. When she arrived in Japan, she joined my bullies. There was no day of my life that I was not brokenhearted but my hatred and the understanding that nobody truly loved me blinded me. I didn’t see anything but black. One time, a dozen of older women surrounded me at the dressing room to fry me. I stood on my knees trying to be strong. I left without finishing my contract when I figured out I was being targeted by one Filipina woman’s boyfriend, who was a yakuza member. I talked to my boss that I didn’t need another hell. Before I left they were all apologizing and crying but I couldn’t believe any of them after putting my life at risk.</p>
            <h3 class="title-animation">Sihanoukville</h3>
            <p>Then, I went to Cambodia with some foreign friends from Manila. We were in Sihanoukville on a tour. There I met a previous casino manager I know and the same friend who set me up at my second work place was with her. She told me she went there to work as a dealer. She said we could do it together. I thought we could be okay again... The first day at work, she was wearing a pitboss uniform and told me that the night before, she didn’t stop asking our manager to give her a chance to be in that position. Every day, she would stand in front of me to display her uniform, to show that her position is higher than mine and would tease me in the table so I’d make mistakes. After five months, I quit my job when my friends. For a period of time I was inactive at church doing dumb things. I felt like if I didn’t do the things I did that were out of the church standards, I would do worse to end my pain. I accepted I was going to hell since not even my family loved me.
            </p>
            <h3 class="title-animation">The Lifeguard</h3>
            <p>I gave up on myself. I was exhausted. I went on a holiday in the Philippines to fix my work papers. While waiting for my documents to be released, I went to a beach in the northern island to think. That beach has magnetic field, part of the Manila Trench. It is where the island’s hydropower is coming from. Once one gets in the field, it would be difficult to get out. They said a few have died there. It didn’t do me good going there. I just felt more alone and worthless, that breathing was pointless. I waited for the lifeguard to leave his post at noon break. I decided to drown myself to death. But, he was there, I didn’t know where he was at but he saved me. He brought me back to the benches. He said “God loves you” and I said “I know that but I wish I was not me. Maybe if I wasn't me, I wouldn't go through those things”. He said try harder, there is always hope then he left me. I was asking myself, hope for what? I didn’t even want anything. I was just crying there for hours. In the afternoon I was looking for him but the resort manager pointed at a different person. That was definitely not him. I described the man. He was huge, muscular, dark, pointy chin and without hair. He looked like a muscular and bald version of Aladdin. He was laughing because there was only one lifeguard. I want to believe he was sent by God to save me...</p>
            <h3 class="title-animation">Another Abuse</h3>
            <p>When I went back to Cambodia, I started attending church and President Collin was there. I finally had my temple recommend renewed after some period of time. Then my ex-husband came to my life. He has been a good friend since after my mission. My friend’s husband introduced him to me. He went to Cambodia for a holiday. We started a relationship during covid and made plans. After he finished college, we got married and not a few days yet, he changed until I found out the things he did while he was in college. I forgave him but every day he treated me like crap. Every day he was making reasons for us to fight. He kept doing what I do not agree with like him leaving before I get home from work. I was alone at home every dinner time. He would mess the house every day before going out welcoming me with mess after an exhausting day at work. I wanted to have dinner together, go to Phnom Penh every Saturday night so we could attend church, split the household choirs because I am also studying at night. I thought those were simple things I could demand from my husband. He was not interested in our marriage.
            <br><br>
            He just wanted to travel right away but I had work to finish and preparations to do so we could transfer to Japan. I was exhausted every day, working all day, studying at night and doing all the work at home. We only met during bed time. He would only get up in the morning if I make breakfast. I found out more about his lies later on when he left his iPad at home. I read a chatbox in his instagram. He told his female friend that he was just traveling Asia and never told his colleagues that he already has a wife. That was why he was rushing to travel, to make his lies come true to other people while keeping me a secret. He was so mad at me and physically hurt me. He told me to leave the church then I said I will choose to suffer or to lose anything for our marriage but not that. A week after that he abandoned me. He wasn’t God’s plan for me. Maybe I was just so happy that someone I love chose me. These past years, I thank God for removing him from my life. I wasted so much on our annulment. Our government did not deem marriage abandonment as a valid ground. I fasted a lot for it until he volunteered to file the divorce in the US. Now I am at peace because I don’t have to do anything anymore with that.</p>
            <h3 class="title-animation">I never wanted anything in my life but to be loved by my loved ones and that was my sin.</h3>
            <p>I spent some time opening the scriptures and when I opened it, the first that showed up was:</p>
            <div class="REL390">
            <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/1?lang=eng&id=p18#p18" target="_blank">Isaiah 1:18</a>
            </div>
            <p style="color: white;">“Come now, and let us reason together, saith the Lord: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.”</p>
            <br>
            <p>Because of the circumstances I went through in my life, I didn’t see how much God actually has been loving me even in those situations. The comfort He was providing, I didn’t feel those. Do I ask God why do I experience so much betrayals? I did, every night. Until this day, I don’t understand but I want to focus on my purpose since I don’t really feel anything positive looking for answers. However, I have difficulty overcoming my fear of making friends with women. I would be kind but I don’t want to have a best friend again. I would be someoen's friend but I don't expect friendship from anyone. I would be someone’s sister but I don’t know what it feels like to have a sister because my sister was the first sister who betrayed me. We recently reconciled and I am so grateful and joyful but we are now on a different stage of life. I don't feel comfortable being at home. I don't know what it feels like to be at home. I don’t know how it feels to be loved back by my loved ones. Those facts made me miserable as a human being but after being saved from death, none of those mattered any more. What does it matter, God’s love is more than enough. I know what it feels like to be loved by God. I know how God loves me. I know the joy of being in His presence. I know my Savior and I know the joy of following His examples.
            <br><br>
            I don’t share my story to everyone I know or to anyone who asks out of curiosity because firstly, I don’t want anyone to hate or judge my family. We all have reasons why we are and why we did what we did. Secondly, I don’t want anyone to feel sad for me or pity me. But maybe by sharing it to someone,  I could testify that there is great strength in  remembering God’s love. Remembering my covenant is as important as remembering God's love. Maybe I could show better how God makes miracles to save us. Maybe I can describe more what hoping means. Maybe by this I could be an example of learning how to be kind. It was never easy to love your enemies. You cannot really learn what it truly means to be kind if you do not experience unkindness just like you cannot learn repentance if you do not sin. If you do not learn repentance, you won't fully understand the Savior's love.
            <br><br>
            Doing right things to others despite whatever others did to me is one thing I can be honestly happy about. I am happy for those who do not have to go through that kind of road. It was painful, bitter, dark, scary, and difficult. I thought I couldn’t get out but God helped me by blessing me wisdom and He softened my heart. Nothing is more important than enduring and serving faithfully, hopefully, prayerfully, obediently and gratefully in any situation. Maybe this life cannot erase our bad memories, if you have one. However, while we still have time, through God’s mercy, we can do better things for others that we all might have better days. I learned to stop expecting anything from anyone around me when I started accepting that nothing can ever fully satisfy my desire for love and protection but Heavenly Father. God has a plan and I hold on to that. Whatever He gives me, I want to embrace it with all my life. Everyone and everything may go away but God will never leave us. I learned to love myself and value the life that was given to me. I learned to be grateful for everything I have. I learned to be kind to everyone, even to those who hurt me. I learned to forgive. I want to be a better daughter of God and be worthy of His plans.
            <br><br>
            Through all the trials and tribulations I have faced, I have come to know that God's love is unwavering and eternal. Even in my darkest moments, when I felt unworthy and broken, He was there, guiding me, lifting me, and reminding me of my worth. I have learned that no matter how far we stray, His arms are always open to welcome us back. My heart is filled with gratitude for His mercy and grace, for the strength He has given me to endure, and for the hope that He has planted in my soul. I testify that through faith, repentance, and obedience, we can find peace and joy, even amidst life's storms. God’s love is real, and it is the greatest gift we can ever receive. I am who I am today because of His love as I went through that road.
            <br><br>
            Nobody knows what lies ahead. I don’t know if I will be married again. I don’t know if I will have my own family. I don’t know if I will be a writer, or a teacher or whatever. One thing for sure, whatever it is, is that God’s plan is enough for everyone to keep going.</p>
